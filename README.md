Item Response Theory
====================

This software fits the 1-PL or 2-PL Item Response Theory model to observed responses.  It consists of an executable and a config file (which needs to be in the same folder as the executable).  The executable is named IRT.exe.  Run it with no arguments to get instructions.

Installation
============

The software runs on Windows and requires Infer.NET 2.6 and .NET 4.5 to be installed.  You can get Infer.NET at http://research.microsoft.com/infernet/ and .NET 4.5 at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=245484.  The config file is set up to look for Infer.NET at "C:\Program Files\Infer.NET 2.6".  If it is installed elsewhere, you will need to edit the IRT.exe.config file.
